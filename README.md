# SDCCL (Steam Deck Comprehensive Control Layouts)

## Overview
SDCCL is a passion project aimed at enhancing the gaming experience on the Steam Deck and similar controllers. The goal is to provide meticulously designed control layouts that ensure comfort and usability with minimal or no effort required by the user to adjust or modify the controls. This project aims to bridge the gap between game design and optimal controller support, empowering players to enjoy their favorite games seamlessly.

## Objectives
- **Accessibility**: Create layouts that cater to a wide range of players, prioritizing ease of use.
- **Optimization**: Tailor layouts to specific games for improved gameplay experience.
- **Respectful Development**: Ensure that the layouts stay true to the intended game mechanics while improving usability.

## Current Status
This project was initiated by me as a solo developer, driven by my passion for ARPGs and improving controller experiences. I am currently the sole contributor, designing and refining layouts on my own time.

## Features
- **Plug-and-Play Usability**: All layouts are designed to work out of the box with no or minimal adjustments needed.
- **Game-Specific Customization**: Each layout is tailored to the unique mechanics and controls of individual games.
- **Compatibility**: Focus on supporting the Steam Deck but with potential adaptability for other similar controllers.

## Why SDCCL?
As a fan of ARPGs like *Diablo*, *Grim Dawn*, and *Path of Exile*, I recognize the challenges of adapting complex games for controllers. SDCCL was born out of the desire to make these and other games more accessible and enjoyable for players using Steam Decks or other controllers.

## Future Plans
- Expand the project to support more games, especially popular ARPGs.
- Collaborate with the gaming community for feedback and suggestions.
- Explore integration with other platforms or tools to reach a wider audience.
- Implement a versioning system for layouts to track updates and improvements.

## How to Contribute
Although this is currently a solo project, I welcome feedback and suggestions. If you have ideas or would like to collaborate in the future, feel free to reach out!
